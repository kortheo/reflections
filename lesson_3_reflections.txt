When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with others. When you want a cloud backup of your files. When you are using multiple devices and want a centralized repository for your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way, you always know the current state of your local repository, rather than wondering if it's up to date or not. It keeps things simpler, and fits with the nature of manual commits. While auto syncing might be convenient, I can imagine there are other times that you would want to not sync the changes from github just yet or until a certain moment.
